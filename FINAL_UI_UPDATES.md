## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### If you don't see the Connect Wallet button:

1. **Check the dev server is running:**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Clear your browser cache:**
   - Hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)

3. **Check console for errors:**
   - Open DevTools (F12)
   - Look for any React/Next.js errors

4. **Verify all dependencies installed:**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

5. **Check you're on the right page:**
   - Navigation bar should be at the top
   - Look for the QuikPay logo on the left
   - Wallet button on the right (desktop)

### If wallet doesn't connect:

1. **Add Push Chain to MetaMask:**
   - Network: Push Chain Donut Testnet
   - Chain ID: 42101
   - RPC: https://evm.rpc-testnet-donut-node1.push.org/
   - Currency: PC
   - Explorer: https://donut.push.network

2. **Get testnet PC tokens:**
